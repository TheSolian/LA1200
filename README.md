## Introduction and Goals

In my Project, I coded a NumberGuess. It's a game where you guess numbers in a range between 1 and 100. For this you have 10 attempts. In the project I wanted t use functions for the better overview but it was difficult to me.

**My goals in this project were:**

- To show you how to use functions in CSharp.
- Why it's useful to use functions.

## Create a function.

You can create a function like this: `static void Function(string parameter) {}`.

You can write parameters like strings or integers after the Name into the brackets.

In the brackets below the function comes the code.

## Why use a function?

When you have parts of your code which repeats often, it's smart when you use a function, because then you only have to call the function and you have to write this code only once.

## Demonstration of a function.


You can see that the program is jump to the function when it reaches the call of the function.

## Verification and Suggestions for improvement

Goal 1: You can find an explenation and a picture of function in section 1.

Goal 2: In senction 2 I explained you why its smart to use a function and demonstrated it to you with a short video.

I had problems in the past, that my code hasn't a good organisation. But I had problems with functions at the beginning.

Now when I understood how functions are working I want to use it more, because it makes your code better.

I recommend you that if you understand functions that you should use them.
